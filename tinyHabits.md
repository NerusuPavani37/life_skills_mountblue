## TINY HABITS

**Question 1:**

_In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?_

_The concept of "Tiny Habits" by BJ Fogg was intriguing, emphasizing the power of small actions for behavior change. The anecdote about the Maui Habit highlighted the effectiveness of starting with tiny, manageable steps to build lasting habits._

**Question 2:**

_How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?_

_BJ Fogg's B = MAP formula suggests that for a behavior to occur, the Motivation (M) to do the behavior, the Ability (A) to perform the behavior, and a Prompt (P) to trigger the behavior must align. Simplifying and optimizing these elements can make forming new habits easier._

**Question 3:**

_Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)_

_Celebrating after each successful habit completion reinforces positive behavior through positive emotions, making the behavior more likely to become a habit._
